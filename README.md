# 🚀 LLM Challenge: 30 Days

## **Objective**
This repository is dedicated to a **30-day journey to mastering LLM (Large Language Models), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), AI Agents, and Generative AI** through structured learning and hands-on projects.

## **Daily Study Plan**
Each day follows these structured steps:  
1. **Watch Courses & Take Notes** 📖  
2. **Read Documentation & Understand Concepts** 📝  
3. **Practice Coding & Run Experiments** 💻  
4. **Develop Mini Projects & Debug Code** 🔧  
5. **Explore Advanced Topics & Interview Prep** 🤖  
6. **Work on LLMOps & Deployment** 🚀
